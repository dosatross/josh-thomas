							<p>After making his mark as an award-winning and hugely-successful stand-up comedian and television panellist, Josh Thomas turned his hand to writing, acting and co-executive producing his own television show for ABC TV, inspired by his life and his comedy, called Please Like Me. When Participant Media in the US chose to launch its brand new Pivot television network with Please Like Me and to co-commission a second season with ABC TV, Josh was on his way to being an international success story. He has been awarded by the Australian Academy (AACTA) and the Australian Writers Guild for his writing for Please Like Me, and has been nominated for AACTA and Logie Awards for his performances in the show. In addition, the show itself has won Best Comedy at the AACTA Awards and been nominated as Best Comedy at the International Emmy Awards, Rose d’Or Awards, GLAAD Media Awards and Logie Awards. The show has gained critical acclaim across the globe, and has been named as one of the best TV shows of year by Entertainment Weekly, The New Yorker, Time, The A.V. Club and the Los Angeles Times. Following on from the show’s success in both Australia and the US, Please Like Me has also been licensed to air in Germany, France, Sweden, Canada, Finland and Israel.</p>

						<h1>Please Like Me</h1>
						<img class="image large-feature-image" src="assets\plm.jpg" alt="Please Like Me">
						<p>Life in your 20’s can be undeniably hard. You could be helping to support your bipolar mother, dealing with a father in a mid-life crisis, and a taking care of your new baby sister—all at once. Maybe you’re attempting to win your boyfriend’s heart one hopeless vegetarian meal at a time. Throughout the whole process maybe the most terrifying conclusion you’ve come to is that you might just be most together person you know.</p>
						<p>That’s what life is like for Josh in the critically acclaimed Please Like Me, a comedy that Entertainment Weekly describes as a “perfect balance of emotional depth and sharp, biting wit." As Josh and his friends muddle through life, sex gets complicated, relationships wax and wane, friends struggle to see eye-to-eye, and the dog always steals the show. Simply put, everything is so delightfully awkward.</p>
						<p>Need more Please Like Me in your life? Have no fear - Please Like Me returns to ABC for Season 4 on November 10!</p>
