						<h1>About The Show</h1>
						<p>Life in your 20’s can be undeniably hard. You could be helping to support your bipolar mother, dealing with a father in a mid-life crisis, and a taking care of your new baby sister—all at once. Maybe you’re attempting to win your boyfriend’s heart one hopeless vegetarian meal at a time. Throughout the whole process maybe the most terrifying conclusion you’ve come to is that you might just be most together person you know.</p>
						<p>That’s what life is like for Josh in the critically acclaimed Please Like Me, a comedy that Entertainment Weekly describes as a “perfect balance of emotional depth and sharp, biting wit." As Josh and his friends muddle through life, sex gets complicated, relationships wax and wane, friends struggle to see eye-to-eye, and the dog always steals the show. Simply put, everything is so delightfully awkward.</p>

							In this hilarious third season, Thomas is enchanting as always as he reprises his role of an unconventionally astute twenty-something whose blasé yet sensitive attitude to -coming out' will have you hooked from the very beginning. After coming to terms with his homosexuality whilst also supporting his bipolar mother Rose (Debra Lawrance, Home and Away, Blue Heelers) post her attempted suicide, Josh cleverly navigates this heavy content in a way that can be described as no less than authentically human.
							The season starts with Josh desperately trying to court his love-interest Arnold with elaborate dates, nearly inedible vegetarian meals and grand romantic gestures. Despite this relentless attempt however, he still can't seem to win him over. Meanwhile, Arnold is preoccupied formulating a -coming-out' strategy for his charmingly wealthy parents, which does not go entirely as planned. This along with life threatening surgery, infidelities and an unforgettable family Christmas lunch are all the reasons you need to indulge in this endearingly delightful instalment of Please Like Me. Join Thomas as he navigates through a cacophony of life's most fabulous exploits and creature comforts; food, sex, drugs, dancing, singing, secrets and a transgender chicken with his trademark obscure hilarity.
							With special guest appearances from Geoff Morrell (Ned Kelly, Rogue), Emily Barclay (Glitch, Suburban Mayhem) and Gina Riley (Kath & Kim, Open Slather), Please Like Me: Season 3 will take you on an emotional journey like no other.

						<p>
							The second season of Please Like Me jumps a few years ahead of where the show last left off, but Josh hasn’t changed much. Sure, he has a new baby stepsister and a hot new roommate that he’s secretly in love with, but the only notable sign of maturity is that he’s finally started flossing. Josh still says the wrong thing at the wrong time. He still makes wildly inappropriate jokes at parties. He’ll spend a whole episode neglecting his friends’ problems while trying to get them to affirm that he’s a nice person. His parents are wondering if he’ll ever get a job.

						<p>
							The first season sent Josh a fit, affectionate boyfriend named Geoffrey (Wade Briggs) to help him address his sexuality, like a sexy angel on a mission. Over those six episodes, Josh and Geoffrey try to get together and then split up three different times. As Geoffrey says, Josh only likes him when he’s lonely. In season two, the roles reverse, but with the permabuzzing Patrick instead of Geoffrey. When either Patrick or Josh brings another date back to their apartment, it’s Patrick and Josh trading subtext. But when they get together, it’s only out of convenience for Patrick. And then there’s Arnold, a patient at the same psychiatric hospital as Josh’s mum. Where Josh and Geoffrey were always crystal clear about their relationship, Josh’s romances in season two live in the tension between singlehood and a relationship. Even Geoffrey’s return thrives on the question of what Josh and Geoffrey are to each other now.
